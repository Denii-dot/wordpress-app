# Wordpress application

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


This is my own application using BEM, sass, redux-toolkit, react-icons, axios and react-router. The app was created on boilerplate create-react-app. This project communicates with the open rest [api of wordpress](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/). With this application we can browse posts, comments, trends, categories. We can navigate to specific posts and authors. As well as save them to bookmarks for later, or liked. These results are not saved on any server. Project to view [here](https://preeminent-dragon-6bd3fd.netlify.app/){:target="_blank"}.
